<h2>Summary</h2>

  <ul id="summary">
    
  <li>We announced the launch of WDQS on Labor Day (Monday, September 7th, 2014) and saw a huge spike in number of users. While the number of users has fallen over time (to around 100 users per day on average), we've seen high usage of the service.</li>
  
  <li>The users of the service are a geographically diverse bunch, representing 73 different countries. Many of the users were from U.S. (17.8%), Germany (13.4%), and France (12.8%). One of the more interesting findings is how much of the usage is by very few users in Republic of Korea.</li>
  
  <li>The majority of WDQS users prefer Chrome (42.1%) and Firefox (26.2%) as their browsers and Mac OS X (26.9%) and Windows 7 (22.2%) as their operating systems. A vast of majority of our users are coming to use the service directly, rather than coming to it from elsewhere on the Internet.</li>
  
  <li>As many as 56.48% of the queries are user-written. In reality, the actual number is smaller because the detection procedure did not take into account French translations of example queries that exist on MediaWiki/Wikitech.</li>
